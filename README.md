## Description 

This site is designed to provide developers with a platform to publish their own and comment on other developers' blog posts. This application follows the MVC paradigm, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage

To use this application, you can sign up to log in. Once you've done this, you can navigate to your dashboard and create a new post. Once you've created a blog post, it will appear in your dashboard and on the homepage. You may also leave comments on other blog posts if they exist. 

If you would like to edit one of your blog posts, you can do so from either the homepage or dashboard by simply clicking on the title of your blog and clicking the "edit" button. There, you can change the title or the content of your blog post. 

## License 

This application is covered under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

## Credits

- My tutor, Alex Gonzalez, helped me create the blog.handlebars file and edit-blog.js file. He taught me how to use the split() method to capture the id from the pathname in a variable and use it in my fetch call on line 10 in the edit-blog.js file. 

- My TA, Enrique Gomez, helped me create the can_edit variable on line 75 in the home-routes.js file so that the edit/delete options only appear if that user is authorized to edit the blog post. 

- I referenced this website for current date/time to use in my Blog and Comments model: https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-basics/#default-values

- I referenced this website for a refresher on media queries https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries

- If I referenced an activity for a certain file, I included a comment that indicates which activity I referenced for each file at the top of that file. I want to include here that I used the same color scheme as Module 14 Activity 17 because I really liked their color combination.
